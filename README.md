Cloudlet: Infrastructure for Mobile Computing
========================================================

A cloudlet is a new architectural element that arises from the convergence of
mobile computing and cloud computing. It represents the middle tier of a
3-tier hierarchy:  mobile device - cloudlet - cloud.   A cloudlet can be
viewed as a "data center in a box" whose  goal is to "bring the cloud closer".
